# Activity-Monitor-ML-Project
The MHEALTH (Mobile HEALTH) dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing several physical activities. Sensors placed on the subject's chest, right wrist and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts, namely, acceleration, rate of turn and magnetic field orientation. 

14 Features:
          alx: acceleration from the left-ankle sensor (X axis)
          aly: acceleration from the left-ankle sensor (Y axis)
          alz: acceleration from the left-ankle sensor (Z axis)
          glx: gyro from the left-ankle sensor (X axis)
          gly: gyro from the left-ankle sensor (Y axis)
          glz: gyro from the left-ankle sensor (Z axis)
          arx: acceleration from the right-lower-arm sensor (X axis)
          ary: acceleration from the right-lower-arm sensor (Y axis)
          arz: acceleration from the right-lower-arm sensor (Z axis)
          grx: gyro from the right-lower-arm sensor (X axis)
          gry: gyro from the right-lower-arm sensor (Y axis)
          grz: gyro from the right-lower-arm sensor (Z axis)
          subject: volunteer number
          Activity: corresponding activity
